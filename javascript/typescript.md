## TypeScript

TypeScript, often mistaken as a proper programming language, is in reality a superset of JavaScript that compiles down to JavaScript.

Javascript is a weakly typed language. Typescript came to fix that by statically typing it.
The good part of it is that TS (strongly typed) compiles before build, so it helps debugging + avoiding possible errors.
