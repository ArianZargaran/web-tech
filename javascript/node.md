## Node

> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Node is a C++ program/executable that provides a JavaScript runtime for us.
As we see on the official diagram, the Node.js runtime is similar to the Web's Browser JS Runtime.

![Node.js Runtime Diagram](../resources/node-runtime-diagram.png)

Node allows us to run JS code out of the browser, for example, on the server.

There are obviously some differences between the Browser's _sandboxed_ environment, and the Node.js env.

- On a browser you'll access the `window` object, while in Node, you'll have the `global` object.
