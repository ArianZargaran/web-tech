## The Web server

A web server is nothing more and nothing less than a computer that hosts the website.

Servers are configured to accept remote connections with Internet users and relay data through HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

In order to decrypt the data packets, the server needs to configure a Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
The Security Certificate for a secured transmission (SSL or TLS) is a digital certificate that contains the key to decrypt data packets. It is required to be installed on the server.

The Security Certificate can be purchased from a reputable vendor which basically will verify information about the Domain and Registrant. If the Registrant is a business, additional documents might be required.

The most secure layer is called EV (Extended Validation).
