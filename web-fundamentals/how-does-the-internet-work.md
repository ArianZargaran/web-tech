# How does the Internet work?

## Internet infrastructure

The Internet is a vast network of cables that facilitates the transmission of "Data Packets".

## The Data Packet

Using the example of an email, the Data Packet is composed by the following parts:

**The Header**
The Header contains crucial information about the package delivery, such as:

- The `Sender's IP Address`
- The `Receiver's IP Address`
- The `Protocol`. Well-established set of rules and standards needed to communicate between machines.
- The `Packet Number`

**The Payload**
The data to be transmitted, in our example, the email itself.

**Trailer**
Carries transmission status information, the end of the packet information, etc.

## Bandwidth: The Speed in numbers

The speed at which the Data Packets can be transmitted is determined by the bandwidth. Bandwidth Transmission Capacity is measured by Bitrate.
The Bitrate is the number of bits per second a digital network can transmit.

_Latency_
The amount of time it takes for 1 bit to be sent from the sender to the receiver.
