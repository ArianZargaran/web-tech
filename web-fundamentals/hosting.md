## Determine the Hosting Solution.

When trying to find the right hosting solution we need to cover at least two needs: `The purpose of testing`, `For Live Production`.

- A web can be either:
  -- Locally, in your personal computer
  -- Shared/dedicated/Virtual Private Hosting
  -- Cloud Hosting

### Intranet Only

--- Requires local server setup
--- PHP and MySQL languages run at the server-side
--- Requires Router Port Configuration

If you want a more efficient/more affordable/less vulnerable to security issues, you might want to delegate the solution fo a third party.

### Traditional Web Hosting

Pre-packaged Hosting Solutions fit many companies needs. It's crucial to pick a trusted and reputable company. Some examples are: _godaddy.com_ or _hostgator.com_.

Traditional Web Hosting house servers in Data Centers. Typically with hundreds or thousands of other servers. The servers are administered and maintained by the hosting company. You need to pay a nominal hosting fee billed monthly or yearly.

### Cloud Hosting

Many Developers now gravitate towards Cloud Hosting.
