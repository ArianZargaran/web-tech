## Setup Local Testing Environment

Setting up a Testing Environment allows us to test a web application locally, rather than uploading to a live Production Server.

This is important since any issues can be captured locally, without sending bugs to production.

The Web Server will be used to communicate with our MySQL database. When installed on a local machine, this server runs on the background and provides essential services through various protocols, and to different ports.
