## Web protocols

**IP** (Internet Protocol) The protocol establishes that each computer connected to a Network (like the Internet) has its unique IP; a string of Numbers separated by periods.

**TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) Protocol that facilitates the transmission of Data Packets. It ensures no information is missing.

**HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Defines how the Internet browser communicates with the web server to display the website. Websites are equally transmitted as data-packets through the Internet.

**HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) The data packages are not encrypted with the HTTP protocol. HTTPS is a more secure protocol that encrypts these data packets using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Security Layer).

- **SSL** (Secure Socket Layer) The data packets are encrypted with the HTTPS protocol. In order to decrypt the packages, the server needs to have a Security Certificate installed on it.

- **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) The protocol that allows the sending of emails.
